🚀 Excited to share my latest project: Power Grid Visualizer for Overland Park, Kansas! ⚡

This is my first time working with Mapbox, and I'm thrilled with what I've built! 🗺️

What it does:
I created a full-stack web application that visualizes real power infrastructure data for Overland Park, Kansas. The app fetches live data from OpenStreetMap and displays:
• ⚡ Transmission lines (high-voltage)
• 📡 Distribution lines (neighborhood level)
• 🏭 Power substations
• 📊 Real-time statistics dashboard

Tech Stack:
• Frontend: React + TypeScript + Mapbox GL JS
• Backend: FastAPI (Python) + Overpass API
• Data Source: OpenStreetMap (real-world data!)
• Features: Interactive layer toggles, click-to-zoom, popups with details, smooth animations

What I learned:
• Working with Mapbox for the first time (so much fun!)
• Integrating real-time geospatial data from OpenStreetMap
• Building interactive map visualizations
• Performance optimization (caching, debouncing)
• Full-stack deployment on Railway

Why I built this:
I wanted to explore geospatial visualization and understand how power infrastructure is mapped in real-world applications. This project combines my interest in data visualization, web development, and learning new technologies.

This is just the beginning! I'm excited to explore more Mapbox features and build even more interactive visualizations. 🎯
