# 🚀 LinkedIn Post - Power Grid Visualizer Project

## Option 1: Detailed & Professional

---

🚀 **Excited to share my latest project: Power Grid Visualizer for Overland Park, Kansas!** ⚡

This is my **first time working with Mapbox**, and I'm thrilled with what I've built! 🗺️

**What it does:**
I created a full-stack web application that visualizes real power infrastructure data for Overland Park, Kansas. The app fetches live data from OpenStreetMap and displays:
- ⚡ Transmission lines (high-voltage)
- 📡 Distribution lines (neighborhood level)
- 🏭 Power substations
- 📊 Real-time statistics dashboard

**Tech Stack:**
- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript + Mapbox GL JS
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python) + Overpass API
- **Data Source:** OpenStreetMap (real-world data!)
- **Features:** Interactive layer toggles, click-to-zoom, popups with details, smooth animations

**What I learned:**
- Working with Mapbox for the first time (so much fun!)
- Integrating real-time geospatial data from OpenStreetMap
- Building interactive map visualizations
- Performance optimization (caching, debouncing)
- Full-stack deployment on Railway

**Why I built this:**
I wanted to explore geospatial visualization and understand how power infrastructure is mapped in real-world applications. This project combines my interest in data visualization, web development, and learning new technologies.

## Option 3: Storytelling Format

---

**From idea to deployment: My first Mapbox project journey** 🚀

I've always been fascinated by maps and data visualization. So when I decided to build something combining both, I knew Mapbox was the way to go - even though I'd never used it before!

**The Challenge:**
Create an interactive visualization of power infrastructure using real-world data. Simple, right? 😅

**What I built:**
A full-stack application that:
- Fetches live power infrastructure data from OpenStreetMap
- Displays transmission lines, distribution lines, and substations
- Provides interactive controls and real-time statistics
- Works seamlessly across devices

**The Tech Stack:**
- React + TypeScript for the frontend
- FastAPI (Python) for the backend
- Mapbox GL JS for map visualization
- Overpass API for OpenStreetMap queries

**What I learned:**
- Mapbox is incredibly powerful and developer-friendly
- Working with geospatial data is fascinating
- Performance optimization matters (caching, debouncing)
- Deployment can be smooth with the right platform (Railway!)

**The Result:**
A working application deployed live, visualizing real power infrastructure in Overland Park, Kansas! ⚡

This project taught me so much, and I'm just getting started. Can't wait to explore more Mapbox features and build even more interactive visualizations!

**Building a Real-Time Power Infrastructure Visualizer with Mapbox** ⚡

I'm excited to share my latest project - a full-stack web application that visualizes power grid infrastructure using real OpenStreetMap data!

**Project Overview:**
The app displays transmission lines, distribution lines, and substations for Overland Park, Kansas, with interactive features like layer toggles, click-to-zoom, and real-time statistics.

**Technical Implementation:**

**Frontend (React + Mapbox):**
- Mapbox GL JS for interactive map rendering
- Dark theme for better visualization
- Custom markers at line endpoints
- Smooth fly-to animations
- Performance optimizations (debouncing, caching)

**Backend (FastAPI):**
- Overpass API integration for OpenStreetMap queries
- GeoJSON conversion and processing
- Haversine distance calculations
- Multi-server fallback for reliability
- TTL caching (30min for power data, 1hr for boundary)

**Key Features:**
- Real-time data fetching from OpenStreetMap
- Bbox-based querying (60km max diagonal)
- Layer visibility controls
- Statistics dashboard
- Responsive design

**Deployment:**
- Backend: Railway (Python/FastAPI)
- Frontend: Railway (React/Vite)
- Environment variable management
- CORS configuration for production

**What I learned:**
This was my **first Mapbox project**, and I'm amazed by:
- How intuitive Mapbox GL JS is
- The power of geospatial data visualization
- The importance of performance optimization
- The joy of seeing real-world data come to life on a map

**Next Steps:**
- Explore more Mapbox features (3D, custom styles)
- Add more interactive features
- Expand to other cities/regions
- Implement path traversal algorithms
